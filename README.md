# Theatre-project
an e-business: a new ticket block booking system that involves ticketbrokers and theaters(or shows). The system consists of multiple ticketbrokers(clients) and multiple theaters(servers). The ticketbrokers can buy in quantity (block) of ticketsfrom the theaters with lower prices, and then resell the tickets to their customers with competitive prices.
